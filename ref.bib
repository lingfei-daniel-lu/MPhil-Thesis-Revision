	pages={339-351},
	abstract={We present the first comprehensive set of firm-level total factor productivity (TFP) estimates for China's manufacturing sector that spans China's entry into the WTO. For our preferred estimate, which adjusts for a number of potential sources of measurement error and bias, the weighted average annual productivity growth for incumbents is 2.85% for a gross output production function and 7.96% for a value added production function over the period 1998–2007. This is among the highest compared to other countries. Productivity growth at the industry level is even higher, reflecting the dynamic force of creative destruction. Over the entire period, net entry accounts for over two thirds of total TFP growth. In contrast to earlier studies looking at total non-agriculture including services, we find that TFP growth dominates input accumulation as a source of output growth.},

	abstract={This paper presents theory and evidence from disaggregated Chinese data that tariff reductions induce a country's producers to upgrade the quality of their exports. We first document stylized facts regarding the effect of trade liberalization on export prices. Next, we develop an analytic framework that relates a firm's choice of quality to its access to imported intermediates. In the model, a reduction in import tariffs induces a firm to increase export quality and raise its export price in industries where the scope for quality differentiation is large and lower its export price in industries where the scope is small. The predictions are consistent with the stylized facts and are highly robust econometrically.},

We document multi-sector exporters’ heterogeneous responses to home currency depreciation. Following currency depreciation, firms tend to export relatively less in sectors that depend more on external financing, to avoid adverse impacts of potentially binding credit constraints. More specifically, credit-constrained exporters respond to currency depreciation by increasing production first in sectors with less external financing dependence, then in sectors that are more dependent on outside funds, until they exhaust their limited financial resources. These findings are consistent with our prior that exporters’ needs for external financing are greater when their home currencies depreciate. Upon home currency depreciation, exporters react by expanding production or by entering new destination markets, incurring significant upfront costs. The results survive a series of robustness checks, and are stronger for low-performance firms and for firms engaged in ordinary trade. The results have important policy implications for emerging market countries that rely heavily on exports but have weak financial institutions.},

	abstract={•Exports of more financially constrained firms are more sensitive to exchange rate changes.•The positive effects on exports of a depreciation are amplified if firm’s access to finance is limited.•The exchange rate pass-through to export prices expressed in domestic currency is lower for firms facing stronger financial restraints. The recent empirical literature estimating the elasticity of exports to exchange rate fluctuations has shown that, while devaluations have in general a positive effect on exports, the size of it varies significantly depending on firm-specific characteristics. Using Chinese firm-level data, we show that exporting activities by more financially constrained firms are more sensitive to exchange rate changes than those by firms with a better ability to raise external capital. This finding is detected at both the intensive and extensive margin of exports. Consistent with the result on export volumes, we also document that the exchange rate pass-through to export prices denominated in the domestic currency is lower for firms facing stronger financial constraints. Moreover, we establish that the role of financial conditions in determining a differential effect of exchange rate on exports continues to be relevant when we allow for a variety of alternative features that may also affect the firm-level elasticity of exports to exchange rate. These are the intensity of use of imported inputs, labor productivity, the degree of price stickiness and firm size.},

The longer time needed for export shipments induces a tighter credit constraint on exporters than on purely domestic firms. In our application to Chinese firms, we find that the credit constraint is more stringent as a firm's export share grows, as the time to ship for exports is lengthened, and as there is greater dispersion of firms' productivities, reflecting more incomplete information.},

	abstract={I propose a model of international trade with liquidity constraints. If firms must pay a fixed entry cost in order to access foreign markets, and if they face liquidity constraints to finance these costs, only those firms that have sufficient liquidity are able to export. A set of firms could profitably export, but are prevented from doing so because they lack sufficient liquidity. More productive firms that generate large liquidity from their domestic sales, and wealthier firms that inherit a large amount of liquidity, are more likely to export. This model offers a potential explanation for the apparent lack of sensitivity of exports to exchange rate fluctuations. When the exchange rate appreciates, existing exporters lose competitiveness abroad, and are forced to reduce their exports. At the same time, the value of domestic assets owned by potential exporters increases. Some liquidity constrained exporters start exporting. This dampens the anti-competitiveness impact of a currency appreciation. Under some conditions, it may reverse it altogether and increase aggregate exports. In this sense, the model is able to rationalize the co-existence of competitive devaluations and competitive revaluations.},

In particular, we investigate the growth impact of banking crises on industries with different levels of dependence on external finance. If banks are the key institutions allowing credit constraints to be relaxed, then a sudden loss of these intermediaries in a system in which such intermediaries are important should have a disproportionately contractionary impact on the sectors that flourished due to their reliance on banks. Using data from 38 developed and developing countries that experienced financial crises during the last quarter century, we find that those sectors that are highly dependent on external finance tend to experience a substantially greater contraction of value added during a banking crisis in countries with deeper financial systems than in countries with shallower financial systems. Our results do not suggest, however, that on net the externally dependent firms fare worse in deep financial systems.},

Despite the negative impact of these channels on capital accumulation and output at the firm-level, we find that they only explain a modest fraction of the gradual increase of exports observed in these episodes. Exports increase since financially-constrained exporters are able to reallocate sales across markets.

	abstract={This article establishes six stylized facts about firms' export prices using detailed customs data on the universe of Chinese trade flows. First, across firms selling a given product, exporters that charge higher prices earn greater revenues in each destination, have bigger worldwide sales, and enter more markets. Second, firms that export more, enter more markets, and charge higher export prices import more expensive inputs. Third, across destinations within a firm-product, firms set higher prices in richer, larger, bilaterally more distant and overall less remote countries. Fourth, across destinations within a firm-product, firms earn bigger revenues in markets where they set higher prices. Fifth, across firms within a product, exporters with more destinations offer a wider range of export prices. Finally, firms that export more, enter more markets, and offer a wider range of export prices pay a wider range of input prices and source inputs from more origin countries. We propose that trade models should incorporate two features to rationalize these patterns in the data: more successful exporters use higher quality inputs to produce higher quality goods (stylized facts 1 and 2), and firms vary the quality of their products across destinations by using inputs of different quality levels (stylized facts 3, 4, 5, and 6).},

	abstract={Changes in nominal exchange rates can lead to expenditure switching when they change relative international prices. A traditional argument for flexible nominal exchange rates posits that when prices are sticky in producers' currencies, nominal-exchange-rate movements can change relative prices between home and foreign goods. But if prices are fixed ex ante in consumers' currencies, nominal exchange-rate flexibility cannot achieve any relative price adjustment. In that case nominal-exchange-rate fluctuations have the undesirable feature that they lead to deviations from the law of one price. The case for floating exchange rates is weakened if prices are sticky in this way. The empirical literature appears to support the notion that prices are sticky in consumers' currencies. Here, additional support for this conclusion is provided. We then review some new approaches in the theoretical literature that imply an important expenditure-switching role even when consumer prices are sticky in consumers' currencies. Further empirical research is needed to resolve the quantitative importance of the expenditure-switching role for nominal exchange rates.},

This paper presents theory and evidence from highly disaggregated Chinese data that tighter credit constrains force firms to produce lower quality. The paper modifies Melitz’s (2003) model of trade with heterogeneous firms by introducing quality choice and credit constraints. The quality sorting model predicts that tighter credit constraints faced by a firm reduce its optimal prices due to its choice of lower-quality products. However, when quality cannot be chosen by a firm in an efficiency sorting model, there is an opposite prediction that prices increase as firms face tighter credit constraints. An empirical analysis using Chinese bank loans data and a merged sample of large trading firms based on Chinese firm-level data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) and Chinese customs data strongly supports quality sorting and confirms the mechanism of quality adjustment: firms optimally choose to produce lower-quality products when facing tighter credit constraints. Moreover, the predictions of the efficiency sorting model are supported by using quality-adjusted prices in regression analysis and by using quality variation across firms within the same product.},

A novel feature of the study is the importance of market share on both sides of the importing relationship — that of the exporting and importing firms. We find that exchange rate pass-through and the currency of invoicing are dependent on the size (or market share) of both importers and exporters. Very small or very large exporters have higher rates of pass-through and tend to invoice in the foreign currency, while it is the opposite for exporters in the middle range. By contrast, for larger importers, pass-through is lower and local currency invoicing is more prevalent. These findings are consistent with a simple model of trade pricing under monopolistic competition with endogenous markups and heterogeneity in firm size (on both sides of the transaction).},

Using U.S. import price micro data, we identify two facts: First, exactly the firms that react the most with their prices to changes in their own costs are also the ones that react the least to changing prices of competing importers. Second, the response of import prices to exchange rate changes is U-shaped in our proxy for market share while it is hump-shaped in response to the prices of competing importers. We show that both facts are consistent with a model based on Dornbusch (1987) that generates variable markups through a nested-CES demand system. Finally, based on the model, we find that direct cost pass-through and price complementarities among importers play approximately equally important roles in determining pass-through but also partly offset each other. This suggests that equilibrium feedback effects in import pricing are large. Omission of either channel in an empirical analysis results in a failure to explain how market structure affects price-setting in industry equilibrium. •Micro data show that prices react to cost shocks and changing competitor prices.•Firms that react the most to changes in their own cost react the least to changing competitor prices.•Equilibrium pass-through is determined by the interplay of heterogeneity in reaction to own cost and competition.•Direct cost pass-through and indirect price complementarity channels play equally important roles.•Omission of either channel implies failure explaining how market structure affects price-setting in industry equilibrium.},

	abstract={highlights•Imported inputs affects the exchange rate pass-through via two channels.•Marginal cost channel serves by changing the marginal cost of export products.•Quality change channel serves by altering exporters’ incentive to change quality.•These two channels generate opposite effects on the exchange rate pass-through.•The marginal cost channel dominates the quality change one for Chinese exporters. This paper examines how the use of imported intermediate inputs affects the exchange rate elasticity of export prices. We first construct a theoretical model to illustrate that a change in imported input cost followed by a change in the exchange rate affects export prices through two distinct channels: directly changing the marginal cost of export products(i.e., the marginal cost channel) and indirectly altering exporters’ incentive to upgrade (or downgrade) the quality of products (i.e., the quality change channel). These two channels generate opposite effects on the exchange rate elasticity of export prices. Our empirical analyses find strong evidence of the existence of the marginal cost and quality change channels. Overall, the marginal cost effect dominates the quality change effect. The marginal cost channel is weaker for products with larger scope for quality differentiation and firms with a higher ability to upgrade quality, as predicted by the theoretical model.},

	abstract={We investigate theoretically and empirically the effects of real exchange rate changes on the behavior of firms exporting multiple products with heterogeneous levels of quality. Our model, which features a demand elasticity that falls with quality, predicts more pricing-to-market and a smaller response of export volumes to a real depreciation for higher quality goods. We provide strong support for the model predictions using a unique data set of Argentinean firm-level wine export values and volumes between 2002 and 2009 combined with experts wine ratings to measure quality. The heterogeneity we find in the response of export prices and volumes to changes in exchange rates remains robust to alternative measures of quality, samples, and specifications. •Study the effects of exchange rate changes on firms heterogeneous in product quality•Our model predicts more pricing-to-market for higher quality goods.•It also predicts that higher quality exports respond less to a real depreciation.•We use a data set of firm-level Argentinean wine exports to support our predictions.•Quality is measured using experts wine ratings.},

	pages={148-161},
	abstract={This paper provides first-hand firm-level evidence on Chinese exporters' reaction to RMB exchange rate movements. We find that the RMB price response to exchange rate changes is very small, indicating relatively high exchange rate pass-through into foreign currency denominated prices, while the volume response is moderate and significant. Furthermore, exporters with higher productivity price more to market, though the pass-through is still very high. Other sources of heterogeneity, such as import intensity, distribution costs, income level of the destination countries, and foreign ownership also matter. Moreover, RMB appreciation reduces the probability of entry as well as the probability of continuing in the export market. •First-hand firm-level evidence on Chinese exporters' reaction to RMB exchange rate movements•The price response is very small, implying high exchange rate pass-through into import prices.•Exporters with higher productivity price more to market.•The volume response is moderate.•RMB appreciation reduces the probability of entry as well as the probability of continuing in the export market.},

	pages={437-492},
	abstract={This article analyzes the heterogeneous reaction of exporters to real exchange rate changes using a very rich French firm-level data set with destinationspecific export values and volumes on the period 1995-2005. We find that highperformance firms react to a depreciation by increasing significantly more their markup and by increasing less their export volume. This heterogeneity in pricingto-market is robust to different measures of performance, samples, and econometric specifications. It is consistent with models where the demand elasticity decreases with firm performance. Since aggregate exports are concentrated on high-productivity firms, precisely those that absorb more exchange rate movements in their markups, heterogeneous pricing-to-market may partly explain the weak impact of exchange rate movements on aggregate exports.},

	abstract={This paper analyzes firm's pricing-to-market decisions in vertically differentiated industries. We first present a model featuring firms that sell goods of heterogeneous quality levels to consumers who are heterogeneous in their income and thus their marginal willingness to pay for quality increments. We derive closed-form solutions for the unique pricing game under costly international trade. The comparative statics highlight how firms' pricing-to-market decisions are shaped by the interaction of consumer income and good quality. We derive two testable predictions. First, the relative price of high qualities compared to low qualities increases with the income of the destination market. Second, the rate of cost pass-through into consumer prices falls with quality if destination market income is sufficiently high. We present evidence in support of these two predictions based on a dataset of prices, sales, and product attributes in the European car industry.},

abstract = {Financial market imperfections severely restrict international trade flows because exporters require external capital. This article identifies and quantifies the three mechanisms through which credit constraints affect trade: the selection of heterogeneous firms into domestic production, the selection of domestic manufacturers into exporting, and the level of firm exports. I incorporate financial frictions into a heterogeneous-firm model and apply it to aggregate trade data for a large panel of countries. I establish causality by exploiting the variation in financial development across countries and the variation in financial vulnerability across sectors. About 20%-25% of the impact of credit constraints on trade is driven by reductions in total output. Of the additional, trade-specific effect, one-third reflects limited firm entry into exporting, while two-thirds are due to contractions in exporters' sales. Financially develope economies export more in financially vulnerable sectors because they enter more markets, ship more products to each destination, and sell more of each product. These results have important policy implications for less developed nations that rely on exports for economic growth but suffer from weak financial institutions. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.
