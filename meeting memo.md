Discussion about future topics: 

- Trading firm's heterogeneous response to shocks
- Read job market candidate papers from top universities in recent years

- Three popular areas: production network, global value chain, multinational enterprise

# 2022.11.11

This week's task on thesis:

1. combine literature review into the introduction
2. contribute to more streams of literature (at least 3)

Discussion about future topics: 

- within-firm resource allocation across markets and exchange rate shocks
- probability estimation of market entry or exit
- product scope adjustment of multi-product firms

Further modifications of literature review:

1. Separate the review of credit constraints literature into two parts: most related papers about credit constraints and exchange rate pass-through, and general literature about credit constraints and international trade.
2. Directly specify the contribution at the beginning of each paragraph. Then describe the most related papers and explain details about our innovation (evidence or method) compared to them.
3. Give positive or complimentary descriptions of previous paper contributions, especially those written by potential reviewers.

Suggested changes to the main content:

1. For main point 1, the difference between the average levels of import and export exchange pass-through in China could be regarded as a motivating fact rather than one of our main findings.
2. For main point 2, we should try to focus more on the difference between effects of credit constraints on import ERPT and export ERPT and the linkage between credit constraints and import bargaining power (sourcing capacity?)
3. For main point 3, the number of import markets would be more strictly described as the import source base rather than import source diversity.
4. Run more tests about effects of credit constraints on ERPT and import market power:
   1. using market share (mean-cutting subsamples or dummy variable, firm-product-country-year level)
   2. using sourcing diversity (value-weighted measure of import sources, firm-year level) 
   3. using trade distance (between China and import sources, country level)
   4. using new importer indicator (dummy variable, firm-year level or firm-country-year level)

Two specifications with market share and credit constraints:

1. $$
   \Delta \ln p_{ijct}=\alpha+\beta_{1} \Delta \ln RER_{ct}+\beta_{2} \Delta \ln RER_{ct} * Credit_{j}+\beta_{3} \Delta \ln RER_{ct} * Credit_{j}*MS_{ijct}+...
   $$

2. $$
   \Delta \ln p_{ijct}=\alpha+\beta_{1} \Delta \ln RER_{ct}+\beta_{2} \Delta \ln RER_{ct} * MS_{ijct}+\beta_{3} \Delta \ln RER_{ct} * Credit_{j}*MS_{ijct}+...
   $$

Three more tests to explain how credit constraints affect importers' sourcing power:

1. long-run vs short-run relationship: import duration (tenure) --- yes
2. scale effect: market share --- yes
3. diversity of network: number of sources ---yes, concentration ratio --- no
4. distance effect: geographical distance from CEPII --- no

# 2022.12.16

Suggestions about improving the test on the effects of alternative sources on ERPT:

1. use exogenous measure of sources: maximum, initial or average
2. use distance as alternative measure of sources

Together we need a wide table for robustness check.

The revised plan of tables and figures:

Data and Measurements:

Figure 1 & 2: nominal and real exchange rate for USD and EUR

Table 1: Summary statistics of main samples

Table 2: Summary statistics of credit constraints measures

Main Results:

Table 3: Baseline estimations of import exchange rate pass-through

Table 4: Importers' credit constraints and exchange rate pass-through

Table 5: Import sources, credit constraints, and exchange rate pass-through

Export versions of Table 3 and 4 are placed in the Appendix (A1 and A2)

Use distance as an alternative measure of import sources is placed in Appendix. (A3)

Robustness check:

Table 6: Robustness: alternative credit constraints measures based on Chinese data

Table A4: Robustness: two-way traders vs pure importers

Table A5: Robustness: ordinary trade vs processing trade

Table 7: Robustness: excluding USD-pegged countries and alternative time period (2009 or later)

Table A7: Robustness: alternative fixed effects

Table A8: Robustness: cross-sectional estimation (FLL 7.1) (to be finished)

Discussion:

Table 8: Heterogeneous markup, credit constraints, and exchange rate pass-through 

- big sellers are also big buyers/ import-export linkage

Table A9: Heterogeneous market share, credit constraints, and exchange rate pass-through

Table A10: Robustness: ownership
